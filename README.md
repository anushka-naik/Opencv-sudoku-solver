# Image processing using OpenCV

The proposed system exhibits proficiency in computer vision and image processing techniques to adeptly solve user-provided Sudoku puzzles. The system is designed to accommodate diverse Sudoku images, initiating the process with adaptive thresholding to enhance image quality and facilitate contour extraction. Subsequent to this, the algorithm identifies and rectifies any warp perspective distortions, ensuring the image is properly aligned for analysis.

Leveraging a pre-trained deep learning model, the system meticulously extracts numerical data from the processed image to reconstruct the Sudoku grid. With the grid accurately identified, the algorithm employs advanced problem-solving techniques to ascertain the solution.
In the final stage, the derived solution is seamlessly superimposed onto the original image, providing users with a visual representation of the solved Sudoku puzzle. This end-to-end solution ensures robust performance, precision, and user-friendly interaction, demonstrating the system's capability in handling intricate image processing and puzzle-solving tasks.
