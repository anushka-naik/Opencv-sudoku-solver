# Image processing using OpenCV

A model that using computer vision and image processing to be able to solve any user inputted sudoku.  
The model accepts any sudoku and pre processes using adaptive thresholding followed by extracting the contours and rectifying the warp perspective in the image if any.   
This is followed by using a pre-trained model to extract the images and rebuild the sudoku and then  solve it and overlay the solution back on the original image.
